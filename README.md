# About me
## My Interest.
As of right now, I'm learning how to knit a sweater a little stressful but it's getting there. I love reading books and love baking. I decided to do cybersecurity because it was an interesting career and wanted to learn more.
## Websites I recommend.
[Ravely](www.ravelry.com) I know it won't show up the full website because you have to sign up. The reason why I would recommend this website because it helps anyone from beginner to advanced what type of projects they want to do. Or somewhat close to the same project and even shows a list what type of yarn to use how many colors and the rows. 
[Fibers](www.oakcityfibers.com) I would recommend this website because I truly like their yarn and are super helpful and very knowlegeable of their yarn!
